I wasn't always lost.

As a child, I was good—studious, active, curious, full of energy. I did well in school, stayed involved, and carried that quiet confidence that life was moving in the right direction. 

I found peace when I stopped chasing happiness and started seeking meaning. I found peace with God. With discipline. With choosing to be good again—not out of fear, but out of clarity. I realized something simple but powerful:

Happiness is not something you hunt down.
It's a byproduct.

When your life is good—your intentions, your behavior, your values—happiness follows quietly. You don't feel it all the time, but you feel steady. Grounded. At peace.

Today, I'm surrounded by friends who matter. Building a startup. Walking a path that feels aligned. My energy is back—not reckless, not restless—but focused. Calm. Honest.

I don't pretend the past didn't happen. It shaped me. But it no longer defines me.

I'm building a life.

And for the first time in a long time, I can say this truthfully:

I am at peace with myself—at last.
