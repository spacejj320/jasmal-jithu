I wasn't always lost.

As a child, I was good—studious, active, curious, full of energy. I did well in school, stayed involved, and carried that quiet confidence that life was moving in the right direction. Somewhere along the way, though, things changed.

Not all at once. Slowly..

Bad habits crept in. Small choices stacked up. And before I understood what was happening, I found myself in situations no fifteen-year-old should ever have to carry. Incidents that hardened me too early. Pain that turned into rebellion. Silence that turned into anger.

I started chasing a flashy life—cheap dopamine dressed up as freedom. Parties, substances, people, attention. For a while, it felt exciting. Alive. Like I was finally in control. But the truth is, I was running—away from myself.

Life kept throwing experiences at me: drugs, nights that blurred into mornings, relationships that burned fast and ended painfully, love that felt intense but unstable, breakups that left more emptiness than growth. I kept thinking the next thing would fix it. The next high. The next person. The next version of me.

It never did.

What finally changed wasn't my circumstances—it was my direction.

I found peace when I stopped chasing happiness and started seeking meaning. I found peace with God. With discipline. With choosing to be good again—not out of fear, but out of clarity. I realized something simple but powerful:

Happiness is not something you hunt down.
It's a byproduct.

When your life is good—your intentions, your behavior, your values—happiness follows quietly. You don't feel it all the time, but you feel steady. Grounded. At peace.

Today, I'm surrounded by friends who matter. Building a startup. Walking a path that feels aligned. My energy is back—not reckless, not restless—but focused. Calm. Honest.

I don't pretend the past didn't happen. It shaped me. But it no longer defines me.

I'm not chasing a high anymore.
I'm building a life.

And for the first time in a long time, I can say this truthfully:

I am at peace with myself—at last.
