subtitle: Designer / Technology Enthusiast

I am a designer and a technology enthusiast. I grew up in Calicut. Curiosity about how things worked led me to study Computer Science and Engineering in Kochi. I started my career as a developer, writing code and building systems. Over time, I became more interested in how technology feels, how it communicates, and how people interact with it. That shift led me into design. In 2016, I started building Ingle Corp with a close friend. We've stayed deliberately unconventional in how we work. No rigid hierarchies. No formula-driven growth. I've been fortunate to surround myself with people who value ideas, philosophy, and integrity I am a strong optimist. I believe in intuition and instinct alongside logic. Not everything meaningful can be reduced to numbers. First principles guide my thinking; instinct guides my decisions. I am spiritual. I believe in God. I try not to complicate things.
