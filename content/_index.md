subtitle: Designer / Technology Enthusiast

I am a designer and a technology enthusiast.

I grew up in Calicut. Curiosity about how things worked led me to study Computer Science and Engineering in Kochi. I began my career as a developer, building systems and writing code. Over time, I became more interested in how technology feels and how people experience it. That shift led me into design.

In 2016, I started building Ingle Corp with a close friend. We've remained deliberately unconventional in how we work. No rigid hierarchies. No formula-driven growth. We think from first principles — questioning assumptions, simplifying complexity, and building things that make sense at the core.

I've been fortunate to be surrounded by people who value ideas, integrity, and philosophy as much as outcomes. The company you keep shapes the work you do.

I am a strong optimist. I trust intuition and instinct alongside logic. Not everything meaningful can be reduced to numbers.

I am spiritual. I believe in God. I try not to complicate things.
