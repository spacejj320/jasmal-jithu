      <div class="content"><p>I wasn&rsquo;t always lost.</p>
<p>As a child, I was good—studious, active, curious, full of energy. I did well in school, stayed involved, and carried that quiet confidence that life was moving in the right direction. Somewhere along the way, though, things changed.</p>
<p>Not all at once. Slowly..</p>
<p>Bad habits crept in. Small choices stacked up. And before I understood what was happening, I found myself in situations no fifteen-year-old should ever have to carry. Incidents that hardened me too early. Pain that turned into rebellion. Silence that turned into anger.</p>
<p>I started chasing a flashy life—cheap dopamine dressed up as freedom. Parties, substances, people, attention. For a while, it felt exciting. Alive. Like I was finally in control. But the truth is, I was running—away from myself.</p>
<p>Life kept throwing experiences at me: drugs, nights that blurred into mornings, relationships that burned fast and ended painfully, love that felt intense but unstable, breakups that left more emptiness than growth. I kept thinking the next thing would fix it. The next high. The next person. The next version of me.</p>
<p>It never did.</p>
<p>What finally changed wasn&rsquo;t my circumstances—it was my direction.</p>
<p>I found peace when I stopped chasing happiness and started seeking meaning. I found peace with God. With discipline. With choosing to be good again—not out of fear, but out of clarity. I realized something simple but powerful:</p>
<p>Happiness is not something you hunt down.
It&rsquo;s a byproduct.</p>
<p>When your life is good—your intentions, your behavior, your values—happiness follows quietly. You don&rsquo;t feel it all the time, but you feel steady. Grounded. At peace.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m surrounded by friends who matter. Building a startup. Walking a path that feels aligned. My energy is back—not reckless, not restless—but focused. Calm. Honest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend the past didn&rsquo;t happen. It shaped me. But it no longer defines me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not chasing a high anymore.
I&rsquo;m building a life.</p>
<p>And for the first time in a long time, I can say this truthfully:</p>
<p>I am at peace with myself—at last.</p>
